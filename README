TMAP - flow mapper

=== Pre-requisites ===
1. Compiler (required):
  The compiler and system must support SSE4 instructions.  GCC 4.3 first 
	privided support for SSE4.

2. SAMtools (optional):
  The following commands rely on linking to samtools:
    tmap sam2fs
  They will will be unavailable if the samtools directory cannot be located.

  The samtools directory must be placed in this directory.  The 
  easiest way to do this is to a symbolic link:
    ln -s <path to samtools> samtools 
  Then the samtools library must be built:
    cd samtools
	make
	cd ..

=== To Install ===

1. Compile TMAP:
  sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make
2. Install
  make install

=== Optional Installs ===
1. TCMalloc
  TMAP will run approximately 15% faster using the tcmalloc memory allocation
  implementation.  To use tcmalloc, install the Google performance tools:
    http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools
  If you have previously compiled TMAP, execute the following command:
    make distclean && sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make clean && make
  After installation, execute the following command:
    sh autogen.sh && ./configure && make clean && make
  The performance increase should occur when using multiple-threads.
